Used [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org) to implement the Facebook Login feature. There are many resources for traditional websites, but not for SPAs.

Facebook's document is so bad that I had to use [passport-facebook-token](https://github.com/drudge/passport-facebook-token) even though I think Passport provides little benefit.
