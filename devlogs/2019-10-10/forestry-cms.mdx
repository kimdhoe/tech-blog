Finished API Design in Node.js course.

Setup [Forestry CMS](https://forestry.io/ "Forestry CMS"), which Iâ€™ve been thinking to give it a try for a while, for contents of devlog. Unlike with other CMS, data are not locked in a cloud. Basically, it gives you a nice writing interface and commits the content to the repository. The setup process was so simple that there was almost nothing to do on my end.

Watched GraphQL introduction course. I've been using GraphQL only in client code. The course was about implementing GraphQL API on server.
