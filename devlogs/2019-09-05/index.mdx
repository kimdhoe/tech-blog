gatsby-background-image renders the same image on multiple instances of a component. I was using Emotionâ€™s `css` prop to set the height of the element so that the background is visible. Seems like the component uses `className` to find a specific target instance to set an image URL. Used plain `style` obejct instead of Emotion.

Configured Contentful to call the ZEIT Now webhook on content publish.
