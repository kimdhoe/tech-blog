Learned about Django’s basic concepts and how to use it.

Used [PipEnv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv), which has similar concepts as npm/yarn. Now that I’m familiar with Node.js, it feels more natural than other options to me.

Project, app, template, view, class-based view, URL, extending template.

API Design in Node.js course.
