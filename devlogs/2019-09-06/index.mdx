Used RN MakedViewIOS for the first time. Good to know it exists.

Used react-native-svg to implement an animation that a point moves along the line of a chart as I swipe. It was very sluggish since (x, y) points were calculated on JS thread. Should try again using Reanimated so that the calculation happens on UI thread.
