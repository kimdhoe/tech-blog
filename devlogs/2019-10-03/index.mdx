Learned React's relatively new concepts. `useEffect`, `StrictMode`, `getDerivedStateFromProps`, `ErrorBoundary`, `getDerivedStateFromError`, `Context`, `useContext`, `useRef`, `useReducer`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useLayoutEffect`, `Portal`.

Event delegation still works on Portal, which is located outside the app root.

Reach router, memoize-one.
