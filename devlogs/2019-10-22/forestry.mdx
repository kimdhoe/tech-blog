Configured Forestry to manage the content of the Now page. It’s a huge advantage to be able to update or post content without a terminal.

I’ve been using text format for the date field because I couldn’t configure the timezone offset. I found it today in the most obvious place.

Forestry admin page can be accessed via /admin route.
