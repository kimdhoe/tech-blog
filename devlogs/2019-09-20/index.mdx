Bought and applied the new domain name, josephk.io. Setup and deployed an empty project to Zeit Now for redirections. josephk.io, dhk.party and www.dhk.party redirects to www.josephk.io now.

`React.memo` memoizes the result and avoids unnecessary renders.

Modified full-screen menu component to look like a sidebar.

Seems like there is no option for invoking a callback after programmatic navigation in Gatsby project. I'm thinking of something like Next's `Router.push`, which returns a promise.
