I'm home in Seoul with my wife _Summer_. We married last May.

Making and polishing this website has been my recent priority. The goal is to develop the habit of documenting dev-related progress as well as other thoughts and events.

Iâ€™m participating in Gatsby localization as a Korean maintainer.

I started to convert JavaScript codebase of this blog over toTypeScript.

We decided to go on a trip to Boston this winter.
