          I am Joseph a web front-end developer. ðŸ‘‹
          <br />
          This website is a personal blog where I share my thoughts and life.

        <h3>Why this site exists</h3>
        <p>
          I am, so to speak, a <em>self-taught</em> software engineer. Having
          said that, I'm always hesitant to describe myself as self-taught,
          since the community around the art of building software has been
          supportive and I could get all the help I needed along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems to me that everyone is learning and everyone is teaching.
          Everyone takes inputs from the community to produce outputs into the
          community. Appreciating the culture of sharing expertise and knowledge
          rather than hoarding, I started this website as a way of contributing
          back to the community.
        </p>

        <p>
          I open up my <em>thoughts</em>, my{' '}
          <em>findings</em>, or just <em>what I'm doing</em>, by simply
          publishing them here, on the internet.

        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>
          I majored in public administration at Korea University. I had been a
          leather crafter for some time, during which I started to learn how to
          code to setup my own retail shop. Since then writing code has become
          my major means of craftsmanship.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have lived in <strong>Seoul, Korea</strong> for 15 years. I am
          currently residing in Songpa District with my lovely wife{' '}
          <i>Summer</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not really a party person, just in case you get the wrong
          impression from the domain name. When I'm not in front of computer, I
          like to spend time with my wife or read a book in a quiet place. I
          love <strong>coffee</strong> and I seldom drink liquor.
