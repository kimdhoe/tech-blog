        <h3>Why this site exists</h3>
        <p>
          I am, so to speak, a <em>self-taught</em> software engineer. Having
          said that, I'm hesitant to describe myself as self-taught. The
          community around the art of building software is so supportive that I
          have always been able to learn from something or someone.
        </p>
        <p>
          it seems to me that every member of this community is not only a
          learner but also a teacher at the same time. A developer, given a
          community input, produces an output to be a help. Appreciating the
          culture of sharing expertise and knowledge rather than hoarding, I
          started this website as a way of contributing back to the community.
        </p>
        <p>
          I open up my <em>thoughts</em>, my <em>findings</em>, or just{' '}
          <em>what I'm doing</em>, by simply publishing them here, on the
          internet.

        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>
          I majored in public administration at Korea University. I had been a
          leather crafter for some time, during which I started to learn how to
          code to setup my own retail shop. Since then, writing code has become
          my major means of craftsmanship.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have lived in <strong>Seoul, Korea</strong> since university. I'm
          currently residing in Songpa District with my lovely wife{' '}
          <i>Summer</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The top-level part of the domain name, although cool, hardly represent
          my personality. I'm not really a party person, just in case you get
          the wrong impression. When I'm away from the computer, I like to spend
          time with my wife or read a book in a quiet place. I love{' '}
          <strong>coffee</strong> and seldom drink liquor.
